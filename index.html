                        <h2>Python</h2>

                        <p>Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that I have extensively utilized to develop robust and efficient solutions. With its clear and readable syntax, Python allows for rapid development and integration of complex functionalities. My experience includes designing and implementing various applications, ranging from data analysis and machine learning models to web development and automation scripts. Leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow, I have been able to analyze large datasets, build predictive models, and streamline workflows. My proficiency in Python is complemented by a strong understanding of object-oriented programming, which enables me to create scalable and maintainable code. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with Python's evolving ecosystem to leverage its latest features and best practices.

                        <p> 
                       I specialize in using Tableau to create dashboards and reports that make data easy to understand. With experience in connecting different data sources, I can bring information together in one place and present it clearly. I design charts, graphs, and interactive visuals that help people quickly find insights and make better decisions. 
                       I also use calculations and filters in Tableau to highlight important details and trends. My goal is always to build dashboards that are simple, fast, and user-friendly so that anyone, even without technical knowledge, can use them easily. I focus on performance optimization, responsive design, and best practices in visualization. By keeping my dashboards clear and well-structured, I ensure they provide real value to teams and businesses. I am passionate about turning raw data into useful insights and delivering solutions that support growth and decision-making.
